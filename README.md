## 🚀 About Me  
I'm someone who treats every challenge like a sandbox — breaking things down, experimenting, and building something purposeful. I enjoy blending **logic, design, and code** to create tools that are not just functional but intuitive and engaging. Whether it’s designing a UI, writing backend logic, or automating with ML, I thrive in the space where creativity meets structure.
